## Personnal Feedback

### Day 1:
Nothing quite remarkable, I wasn't going to use splitOn at first but I decided
it was cleaner to use it (I am not sure it is standard though.)

### Day 2:
Because this is really simple to solve, I tried to do it in the most cumbersome
and compact way possible. Basically, the idea is to put everything in a matrix
and notice that there is a cycle to the possible scores.

### Day 3:
Weirdly enough, I really liked this one. I am quite proud of my solution :D

### Day 4:
It is way too early for me to be awake, my solution is quite silly but it works.

### Day 5:
The hardest part about this one was the parsing, and even that wasn't too hard
