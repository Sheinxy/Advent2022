Watch me code in Haskell for 25 days straight

## Personnal Feedback

### [Day 01](/Day 01):
Nothing quite remarkable, I wasn't going to use splitOn at first but I decided
it was cleaner to use it (I am not sure it is standard though.)

### [Day 02](/Day 02):
Because this is really simple to solve, I tried to do it in the most cumbersome
and compact way possible. Basically, the idea is to put everything in a matrix
and notice that there is a cycle to the possible scores.

### [Day 03](/Day 03):
Weirdly enough, I really liked this one. I am quite proud of my solution :D

### [Day 04](/Day 04):
It is way too early for me to be awake, my solution is quite silly but it works.

### [Day 05](/Day 05):
The hardest part about this one was the parsing, and even that wasn't too hard

### [Day 06](/Day 06):
Easiest one.

### [Day 07](/Day 07):
This one was a bit harder, but once the parsing is done then it's not that hard.
Is it weird that part 2 was easier than part 1 for me ?
Anyway, tree traversals go brrrrrr (although I'd hoped to make my code clean
which isn't the case right now :,()
