Watch me code in Haskell for 25 days straight

## Personnal Feedback

### [Day 01](./Day_01):
Nothing quite remarkable, I wasn't going to use splitOn at first but I decided
it was cleaner to use it (I am not sure it is standard though.)

### [Day 02](./Day_02):
Because this is really simple to solve, I tried to do it in the most cumbersome
and compact way possible. Basically, the idea is to put everything in a matrix
and notice that there is a cycle to the possible scores.

### [Day 03](./Day_03):
Weirdly enough, I really liked this one. I am quite proud of my solution :D

### [Day 04](./Day_04):
It is way too early for me to be awake, my solution is quite silly but it works.

### [Day 05](./Day_05):
The hardest part about this one was the parsing, and even that wasn't too hard

### [Day 06](./Day_06):
Easiest one.

### [Day 07](./Day_07):
This one was a bit harder, but once the parsing is done then it's not that hard.
Is it weird that part 2 was easier than part 1 for me ?
Anyway, tree traversals go brrrrrr (although I'd hoped to make my code clean
which isn't the case right now :,()

### [Day 08](./Day_08):
Ah yes, my favorite time of the year: manipulating 2D grids in Haskell (/s)
Well, it didn't go so bad, I definitely feel like I'm getting better at this every year!

### [Day 09](./Day_09):
I spent so much time on this simply because I didn't understand properly how
moving works

### [Day 10](./Day_10):
Definitely one of the easiest ones so far (not as easy as Day 6, but still really easy)!
I'm pretty sure that, had I woken up before 6AM today, I could actually have been in the leaderboard 🙀

### [Day 11](./Day_11):
Definitely one of the hardest to implement in Haskell so far. Proud to be a maths enthusiast

### [Day 12](./Day_12):
Probably my cleanest BFS in Haskell

### [Day 13](./Day_13):
This. This is the day I can proudly say "I know a bit of Haskell".

### [Day 14](./Day_14):
Highly unoptimised solution goes brrrr (part 2 takes like 1 second to run :ono)
